# super(): Inside a child class, super() lets you call methods from the parent class. This is useful when you want to extend the parent's behavior instead of completely replacing it. It's especially important when initializing the parent class's part of a child object.

# Calling Parent Constructor with super()
class Bird(Animal):
    def __init__(self, name, wingspan):
        super().__init__(name)  # Call Animal's __init__ to set the name
        self.wingspan = wingspan # Add a Bird-specific attribute

my_bird = Bird("Tweety", 10)
print(my_bird.name)      # Output: Tweety (set by Animal's constructor)
print(my_bird.wingspan)  # Output: 10   (set by Bird's constructor)
